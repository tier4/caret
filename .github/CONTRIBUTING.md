## Issues

### Create a new issue

When you create a new issue, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/tier4/caret/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and [search FAQ in the document for known issues/solutions](https://tier4.github.io/CARET_doc/main/faq/).

CARET consists of multi repositories and this repository is a meta repository. A new issue should be created in [this meta repository](https://github.com/tier4/caret), unless the issue is explicitly related to a certain repository.

### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/tier4/caret/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

## Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR. Your PR will be submitted to a sub repository, so don't forget to link the PR to a issue if you are solving one.

Your PR needs to pass checks in workflows like pytest, spell check, etc. Also, code review and approval from one or more other developers are required to be merged.
