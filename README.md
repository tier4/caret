# CARET

CARET (Chain-Aware ROS Evaluation Tool) is one of performance analysis tool dedicated with ROS 2 applications. It is able to measure not only callback latency and communication latency, but also path latency, in other words, chain of node or callback. As additional tracepoints are introduced by function hook, tracing resolution is improved.
